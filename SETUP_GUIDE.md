## üîß Current Configuration

# Clerk Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_***
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_***

# Google Gemini AI
NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyC***

# Database
DATABASE_URL="mysql://root@localhost:3306/ai-kids-story"

# Cloudinary
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=delen7nxs
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=897976322449223
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=wcL***

# Hugging Face
HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY=hf_yloB***
```

---

## üèÉ How to Run the Application

### 1. **Ensure Database is Running**

Make sure your MySQL server is running on `localhost:3306` with the database `ai-kids-story` created.

```bash
# If you haven't created the database yet:
mysql -u root -p
CREATE DATABASE `ai-kids-story`;
```

### 2. **Generate Prisma Client**

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

**Note:** If you get a permission error on Windows, close any running instances of your app and try again.

### 3. **Run Database Migrations**

Apply the Prisma schema to your database:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

Or if migrations already exist:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

### 4. **Install Dependencies** (if not already done)

```bash
npm install
```

### 5. **Start the Development Server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at: **http://localhost:3000**

## üìù How Story Creation Works Now

### User Flow:

1. **User navigates to Create Story page** (`/create-story`)
2. **Fills in the form:**
   - Story Subject (e.g., "A magical forest adventure")
   - Story Type (Educational, Adventure, Sci-Fi, etc.)
   - Age Group (5-8, 9-12, etc.)
   - Image Style (Paper cut, 3D, Watercolor, etc.)
   - Privacy setting (Public/Private toggle)

3. **Clicks "Generate Story"**
   - Loading screen appears
   - **AI generates story content** using Google Gemini
   - Story is **saved to database** with user ID
   - **Cover image is generated** using Hugging Face
   - **Chapter images are generated** for each chapter
   - All images are **uploaded to Cloudinary**
   - Image URLs are **stored in database**

4. **User is redirected** to view their new story in a beautiful flipbook format (`/view-story/[id]`)

### Expected AI Response Format:

The Gemini AI returns a JSON structure like this:

```json
{
  "storyTitle": "The Enchanted Forest",
  "storyCover": {
    "imagePrompt": "A magical forest with glowing trees..."
  },
  "chapters": [
    {
      "chapterNumber": 1,
      "chapterTitle": "The Beginning",
      "description": "Once upon a time...",
      "imagePrompt": "A young child entering a magical forest..."
    },
    // ... more chapters
  ]
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### API Rate Limits:

- **Hugging Face:** Free tier has rate limits for image generation (may queue requests)
- **Google Gemini:** Has daily quota limits

### Image Generation Time:

- Cover image: ~10-20 seconds
- Each chapter image: ~10-20 seconds
- Total time for 5 chapters: ~1-2 minutes

If image generation is taking too long, you can implement:
- Background job processing

### Database:

- Stories are stored with all metadata
- Images are stored separately with references to stories
- Likes and comments are properly indexed for performance
